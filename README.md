# Data Structures Projects

This repository contains two JavaScript projects that demonstrate fundamental data structure implementations:

## Linked List Traversal

This project implements a simple linked list, allowing users to create a linked list, add elements, and traverse the list to print its contents.

## Stack Implementation

This project provides a stack implementation using an array. It includes methods to push and pop elements, check if the stack is empty, and peek at the top element.

## Usage

To use these implementations, clone the repository and run the desired project files using Node.js.
